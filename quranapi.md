# README

Main docs are [here](https://quranapi.hashir.pro/docs/)

It supports:

- `/api/chapter/verse/:chapterVerse` ~ Will get a single `verse` by specifying chapter and verse like [`2:32`](https://quranapi.hashir.pro/api/chapter/verse/2:32) i.e. chapter 2 verse 32. This API also supports search inside the verse as well.
